# Roboy-ROS-Unity
ROS# for ROS connection in Unity with our custom messages.

# General
- We're using the [ROS#](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp) library by Siemens.
- Custom messages can be added in RosBridgeClient/Messages/Roboy, after that you need to recompile the library. You may follow [this](https://github.com/siemens/ros-sharp/wiki/Dev_NewMessageTypes#option-2-generate-messages-in-the-rosbridgeclient-library) instructions.
- All custom message definitions can be found [here](https://github.com/Roboy/roboy_communication).
